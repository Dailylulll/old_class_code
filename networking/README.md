# ChatRoom Program

This is a simple chatroom program using python and unix sockets. V1 is single threaded and V2 is multithreaded. I think this is a cleaner example of my work. The problem was constrained so I could not fully use library functions. Also I regret not using a cleaner message passing system, and there might be a little OOP abuse.
