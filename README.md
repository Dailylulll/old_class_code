The examples here are from various different classes for schoolwork. The level of polish varies as I was frequently learning the algorithms, language features, debugging strategies and best practices all at the same time. Yikes. There are frequent examples of me trying to reininvent the wheel, changing how I write code idiomatically, apparent refusal to organize and inclusion of redundant code. Hardly shining examples of pristine documentation, DRY and design patterns. Despite my hesitations, I would still a public record of my work, and hopefully provide an example of how I improve over time.

Unfortunately in spring 2023 my laptop hdd crashed and I lost my personal pet projects. I learned the lesson of backing up data the hard way. The C code recovered in this file is what I was able to recover from school submissions.
